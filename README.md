Final Year Project: Sustainability-Themed Mobile App (Flutter)
Project Overview:
Developed a mobile application using Flutter, focused on promoting sustainability and encouraging eco-friendly habits. The app incentivizes users to reduce plastic waste and recycle responsibly by offering a points system, locating nearby recycling bins, and providing guidance on how to dispose of various items.

Key Features:
Points System
Plastic Bag Savings: Users earn points for each plastic bag saved.
Voucher Redemption: Accumulated points can be redeemed for vouchers from partnered eco-friendly stores.
Achievement Badges: Users earn badges based on the points they accumulate, motivating continued eco-friendly behavior.

Nearest Recycling Bins (eBins)
Utilizes geolocation to help users find the nearest recycling bins.
Provides directions and additional information about the recycling facilities.

Item Scanning and Recycling Information
QR Code scanner: Scan QR code to redeem points
Image Scanner: Users can scan items to identify the type of waste (e.g., plastic, glass, paper).
Recycling Instructions: Offers information on how to properly recycle each type of item, ensuring correct disposal and maximizing recycling efficiency.
Technology Stack:
Frontend: Flutter for cross-platform mobile app development (iOS and Android).
Backend: Firebase for real-time database, user authentication, and cloud functions.
APIs: Integrated geolocation APIs to locate recycling bins.
Machine Learning: Implemented basic ML model for image recognition in item scanning.
Achievements:
Designed a user-friendly interface to simplify eco-friendly practices.
Implemented a reward system to encourage sustainable behavior.
Facilitated easier recycling through accurate bin location and item-specific recycling instructions.
